# Node Yabe

A simple (but yet another) blog engine written in node.js. It basically takes the `articles/` folder full of markdown post and serves them as a website.

npm is not used yet, the dependencies are built-in in this repo, except for datejs;

In order to use it:
* clone it
* $> git submodule update --init --recursive
* $> npm install datejs

connect as a middleware stack (namely for router). nodejs v0.4.x

h5b [node.js](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate-server-configs/blob/master/node.js)(thanks xonecas!) server configuration is used.

[node-jqtpl](https://github.com/kof/node-jqtpl) for templating.

markdown and prettify node module are node ports of showdown and prettify syntax highlighter by [creationix](https://github.com/creationix) for the [Wheat](https://github.com/creationix/wheat) blog engine.

This is a work in progress (and mostly just fun).

Yabe mainly due to my lack of inspiration when it comes to chose a name. I chose to create yet another blog engine. It is a reference to this [play](http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.0.1/guide1#aTheprojecta) framework sample project.
